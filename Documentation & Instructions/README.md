# Documentation and Instructions
This open-data project for the City of Windsor allows users to view data sets and use that data information for making business decisions. 

Phase 1:
In this very first phase of our project was to make Inception report who followed a FURPS+ model. We also wanted to demonstrate what new data portal website will look like and therefore, we coded (front-ended, soon to be coded back-end) our website which can be found [here](http://comp3220.bhagatr.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/).

Phase 2:
Within the respositories you will find information on the inception report, which entails the outline of the project. You will also find information on the phase 2 of the project which starts the first iteration of the project cycle complete with a report detailing the tools used, management methods, proof of concepts and other information.

Phase 3:
In this repositories, you will find the information on the summary report for phrase 3,  which will overview the entire process and objectives of the current phrase. You will also find 5 pictures of UML diagrams that represent 5 different GRASP pattern designs, and you will find an pdf report, proof of concepts, [project management tools](https://github.com/stunnashadez/3220Project/projects/1), [wiki page] (https://github.com/stunnashadez/3220Project/wiki), and [version control](https://github.com/stunnashadez/3220Project/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr).
